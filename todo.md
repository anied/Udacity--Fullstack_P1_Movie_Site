###~~Caching~~
Set the code to properly cache the data response (somehow with trailers included) every 24 hours, for performance purposes and to avoid exceeding any rate limits.

###~~Popovers~~
Leverage Bootstrap so that hover-over of the films shows a tooltip or popover with the movies stars and a synopsis.

###~~Caching--~~ ~~_EXTREME!!!_~~
Once the tooltips/popovers section is done, rewire the caching to simply fire off the pre-built page, rather than rebuilding it each time.

###~~Optimize~~
Go through and fix those locations where an entire library is being imported, instead of just those methods used.
